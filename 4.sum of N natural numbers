# Python program to print sum of N natural numbers
# Find the Sum of N Natural Numbers in Python
# Given an integer input number, the objective is to sum all the numbers that lay from 1 to the integer input number and print the sum. In order to do so we usually use iteration to sum all the numbers until the input variable number.

# Example
# Input : number = 5
# Output : 15
# Explanation : 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15


# Method: Using for Loop
# In this method we’ll use for loops to iterate through all the numbers until the integer input “number” is reached.

number,sum = int(input("Enter a Number:")) ,0
for i in range(number+1):
  sum+=i # same as sum = sum + i.
print(sum)

# Initialize the required variables.
# Using for loop iterate from 0 to number+1.
# Meanwhile append the num
