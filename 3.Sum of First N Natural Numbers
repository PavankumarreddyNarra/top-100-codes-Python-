 # Python Program to Find the Sum of First N Natural Numbers
 # Find the Sum of The First N Natural Numbers in Python
# Given an integer input the objective is to write a code to Find the Sum of First N Natural Numbers in Python. To do so we simply keep adding the value of the iter variable using a for loop.

# Example
# Input : num = 8
# Output : 36

# Where first 8 number is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
# Sum of numbers = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 36

# Method 1 : Using for Loop
# In this method we’ll add all the natural numbers until the given integer input using for loop in Python.


num = int(input("Enter a Number:")) 
sum = 0
for i in range(num+1):
  sum+=i    # same as sum = sum + i.
print(sum)

# Initialize a variable sum = 0.
# Using a for loop in iteration ‘i’ iterate between [1, num].
# Each time add ‘i’ to current sum as sum = sum + i.
# Print sum.
