# Check if a Year is a Leap Year or Not in Python
# Given an integer input year, the objective of the code is to Check if a Year is a Leap Year or Not in Python Language. To do so  we’ll check if the year input satisfies either of the two conditions of leap year.

# Example
# Input : 2020
# Output : It's a Leap Year.


year = int(input("Enter a year:"))

if (year%400 == 0) or (year%4==0 and year%100!=0):
    print("it's a Leap Year")
else:
    print("it's a Not a Leap Year")
    
    
# Check if the year variable is divisible by 400.
# Check if the year variable is divisible only by 4 and not 100.
# If the above mentioned conditions are satisfied, prints “Leap Year”, print “Not a Leap Year” otherwise.
