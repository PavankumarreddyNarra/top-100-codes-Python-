# Find the Sum of the Numbers in a Given Range
# Given two integer inputs as the range [ low , high ], the objective is to find the sum of the numbers that lay in the intervals given by the integer inputs. Therefore weâ€™ll write a code to Find the Sum of the Numbers in a Given Range in Python Language.

# Example
# Input : 2 5
# Output : 14

num1 = int(input("Enter a low Number:"))
num2 = int(input("Enter a high Number:"))
sum = 0
for i in range(num1,num2+1):
  sum+=i   # same as sum = sum + i.
print(sum)


# Initialize the required variables.
# Run a for loop from num1 to num2+1 i.e [num1,num2].
# Append i to sum variable with each iteration.
# Print sum variable.
