# Python Program to check if a Number Is Positive Or Negative
# Given an integer input, the objective is to write a code to check if a number is positive or negative in the python Language.

# For Instance,
# Input : num = 20
# Output: The number is positive.


#Method - 1
num = int(input("enter a number:"))
if num > 0:
    print ("The number is positive")
elif num <0:
    print("The number is negative")
else:
    print("The number is neither positive nor negative")
    
# Initialize num by taking input from user.
# If the num > 0: it is a positive number.
# If the num < 0: it is a Negative number.
# Else the number has to be zero itself


#Method - 2 (Nested if statements)
num = int(input("enter a number:"))
if num>=0:
    if num==0:
        print('Zero')
    else:
        print("Positive")
else:
    print("Negative")

#Initialize by taking input from user.
#If the num >= 0
#If num == 0 : num is zero
#Else number has to be positive 
#Else the number has to be negative

#Method 3 (Using Ternary Operator)

num = int(input("enter a number:"))
print("Positive" if num>=0 else "Negative")

Initialize num by taking input from user.
print the output using ternary operator in python using print () function.
